# Team Profile Generator
Max, Tom, and I worked on this assignment together. In the app.js file, the code will have functions and methods that will be imported/reqired from the other js files. A class will be made and sub-class will call on the parent call in order to inherit the parent methods and proporities. At the bottom of the app.js file, a function will be made to render the data into a html file. This part was a challege, but with Max's help, we were able to render and joined the objects and arrays together onto a new html file.
## Description
As a user, I am able to build a team of employees through node.js's prompt. With the prompts, I am able to input employee's information. This data will then render onto a html file.
## Not Included
The only thing that we didn't really get to was the bonus. Other than that, I feel like we complete this assginment well.
